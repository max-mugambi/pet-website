                <h1>Welcome to the about us page</h1>
                <p>you came here to know about us right? Im going to give you just that</p>
            <p>we rescued animals because we felt like there is no need for the loss of animals any animals.</p>
            <p>We started rescuing animals 4 years ago and ever since that day we have bever missed a place where a natural disadture hit and there are still animals there</p>
            <p>It started as a small thing but now we have branches all over the world so save each and every one of them</p>
            <p>We never considered making a pet store but we were running out of space to keep them so one of the co-workers sugested that we make a pet store to give the animals to loving owners</p>
            <p>the business slowly blew up and now became one of the best in the country but we are trying to make it one of the best world wide</p>
           <h3>Alot of people are asking us to start shipping the pets and now we have started fif you want us to ship it to you go to the contact page</h3>
